# ME 597 Autonomous Systems Final Project - Dante Sanaei
The project was the development of a self driving algorithm using ROS for a car/terrain gazebo simulation. The car had to perform lane/road following, obstacle avoidance, and stop at a gas station. A video of the simulation is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGQT7unUnQ&t=112s&ab_channel=DanteSanaei)
